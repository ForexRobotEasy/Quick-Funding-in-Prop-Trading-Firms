This code represents an Expert Advisor (EA) designed for quick funding in prop trading firms. It aims to generate swift profits through automated trading in the forex market. The EA sets a profit target and an equity protection threshold, and continuously monitors market conditions to identify trading opportunities. 

## Global Variables

- `profitTarget`: The desired profit target in pips.
- `equityProtection`: The equity protection threshold in the account's base currency.
- `isTradingAllowed`: A flag indicating if trading is allowed.

## Initialization

The `OnInit()` function initializes necessary components for the EA to function properly. This function is called once when the EA is attached to a chart.

## Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit()` function deinitializes necessary components before the EA is removed from the chart. This function is called once when the EA is removed.

## Start Trading

The `OnTick()` function is the main entry point for trading. It is called on every tick of the market. In this function, the EA performs the following tasks:

1. Checks if trading is allowed. If not, it returns.
2. Checks if the profit target is met. If yes, it halts the EA and prints a message.
3. Checks if the equity protection threshold is reached. If yes, it halts the EA and prints a message.
4. Analyzes market conditions and identifies trading opportunities.
5. Executes trades based on the identified opportunities.
6. Manages stop-loss and take-profit levels.
7. Monitors account equity.

## Helper Functions

The code also includes two helper functions:

1. `GetProfit()`: Calculates the current profit based on the trades executed by the EA.
2. `AccountEquity()`: Calculates the current account equity.
